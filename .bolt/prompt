For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

Code Handling Protocol:
- For files under 400 lines: Automatically implement fixes and changes
- For files over 400 lines: Provide code snippets with exact file location and line numbers
- Always verify file size before implementing changes
- Consider browser limitations when handling large code blocks
